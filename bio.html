					<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

Formerly an Applied Psychology major, a deep-seated desire for creative freedom led me to switch to Visual Communication Design in 2012.

					I'm currently finishing up my major in VCD, wrapping up my stay at Eastern in Winter 2015.

					I'm a former illustrator and graphic artist who worked for the college paper, The Easterner. The areas that I tend to do well in include information design and logo design/branding. The areas I'm really trying to focus on is understanding and practicing responsive web design, and overcoming shyness when presenting my work.</p>
